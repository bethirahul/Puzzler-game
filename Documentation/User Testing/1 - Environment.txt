1. Could you tell me how big you think you are in this experience?
A. Little bit shorter than normal, by about half feet.

2. What would you say is the mood of the place taht you're in?
A. An old room - in a fort, just like in games like Assassins creed. Little spooky, some enemy would come, but looks okay due to the spheres, Like a party balls.

3. Is there anything that you would like to look at but that's difficult to see to that's not coming out very well visually, for you?
A. Everything looks pretty much okay. No complaints. I think I environment outside the room seems basic. I thinks its on purpose. A phone cannot handle much processing.
